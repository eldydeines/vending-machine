# React Router Vending Machine
For this assignment, you should use the React Router to build a vending machine!

What does this mean? Your application should consist of the following:

- A VendingMachine component, which shows a page with a list of snacks that you can get from the vending machine.
- At least three different snack components, each one corresponding to a vending machine snack.
- By clicking on an item in the VendingMachine you can view one of things inside of the machine. Clicking should update the URL and show the snack that you’ve clicked on.
- From each snack component, you should be able to go back to the main VendingMachine component.
